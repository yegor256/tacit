## How to contribute

Fork repository, make changes, send us a pull request. We will review
your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly, provided
they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration, before
sending us your pull request please run full Grunt build:

```
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

To develop it locally, open `index.html` in a browser and then run:

```
$ npm run dev
```

Now you can make changes to `.scss` files and refresh the page in the browser.
CSS will be recompiled automatically on every change you make.
