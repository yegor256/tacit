**Tacit** is a primitive [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) framework
for dummies, like myself, who
don't know anything about graphic design but want their web services to
look edible. No classes, no layouts, just design plain and simple web pages
compliant with [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), and they
will look OK.

The details are here:
[yegor256.github.io/tacit](https://yegor256.github.io/tacit/)

Simply add this to your HTML (you may also add the
[`integrity`][SRI] attribute, generated
by [srihash.org](https://www.srihash.org/)):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tacit-css@1.9.3/dist/tacit-css.min.css"/>
  </head>
</html>
```

Otherwise, download [`tacit-css.min.css`][CDN]
and use it together with your HTML by adding the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="tacit-css.min.css"/>
  </head>
</html>
```

Of course, it is
[responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)
and mobile-friendly, but you have to add this line too:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
  </head>
</html>
```

This blog post explains it in even more detail:

## Built on top of Tacit framework

Tacit's goal is to be super simple and always with the same look-and-feel.
If you want something more custom, like a different theme,
feel free to make it on top of Tacit. Here are some frameworks
built on top of Tacit:

* [kacit](https://github.com/Kimeiga/kacit) Kacit is the
Tacit CSS classless framework but with a yellow accent and Georgia font
* [Bahunya](https://github.com/kimeiga/bahunya) is a CSS framework
with responsive typography, navbar, syntax highlighting, and much more,
inspired by Tacit

## How to contribute

Fork repository, make changes, send us a pull request. We will review
your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly, provided
they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration, before
sending us your pull request please run full Grunt build:

```bash
npm install
grunt
```

To develop it locally, open `index.html` in a browser and then run:

```bash
grunt dev
```

Now you can make changes to `.scss` files and refresh the page in the browser.
CSS will be recompiled automatically on every change you make.

If installation fails
([fails for me](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/3184)
on Apple Silicon MacBook), you may try to use Docker:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/tacit" yegor256/python /bin/bash
# Now, inside the container:
cd /tacit
/usr/bin/install-node.sh
npm install
npm install --force -g grunt-cli
grunt
```
