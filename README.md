**Tacit** is a primitive CSS framework for dummies, like myself, who
don't know anything about graphic design but want their web services to
look eatable. No classes, no layouts. Just design plain and simple web pages
compliant with HTML5 and they will look OK.

Details are here: [yegor256.github.io/tacit](https://yegor256.github.io/tacit/)

Just add it to your HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/yegor256/tacit@gh-pages/tacit-css.min.css"/>
  </head>
</html>
```

Or simply download [`tacit-css.min.css`](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/yegor256/tacit@gh-pages/tacit-css.min.css)
and use together with your HTML by adding:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="tacit-css.min.css"/>
  </head>
</html>
```

Of course, it is [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)
and mobile-friendly, but you have to add this line too:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
  </head>
</html>
```

This blog post explains it in even more details:

## How to contribute

Fork repository, make changes, send us a pull request. We will review
your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly, provided
they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration, before
sending us your pull request please run full Grunt build:

```
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

To develop it locally, open `index.html` in a browser and then run:

```
$ npm run dev
```

Now you can make changes to `.scss` files and refresh the page in the browser.
CSS will be recompiled automatically on every change you make.

### Commit messages guidelines

* Every commit/PR should preferably be linked to a Github issue. If it's not, it's recommended to create an Issue first and then commit and open a PR;
* Commit messages should follow this pattern:

```
 #<issue-number> - short description

(optional) * bullet-points with more details if necessary
```
* If the pattern is not followed - commit messages should at the very least reference the `#<issue-number>`.

## Browser/OS Compatibility
